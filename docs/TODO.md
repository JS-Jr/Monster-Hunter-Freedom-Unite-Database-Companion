# TODO

### Weapons

* Fix the `+` characters on some weapons (we use these in the weapon detail page; currently they get converted in URLs and go to the wrong weapon).
* Fix weapon tree.
* Add suggested elemental damage (add the elemental values then average them as a temporary value).

### Pages / UI

* Mobile / responsive page view.
* Put page number and sorting in the URL for bookmarking.
* Fix table issue with auto-changing column width.

### Maps / Filters

* Add filter in maps (show only pins and the side that matches the filter).
* Linking titles (if an item/potion is mentioned in notes or description, link it to its page; link map names like "Snowy Mountains" to `/maps/snowy%20mountains`).

### Content / Details

* Add skills, decorations, quest details (what quest to do to unlock next star/hr).
* Create a decoration/skill builder (like: use armor set X and use this decoration).
* Add images.

### Documentation / Dev

* Update README.
* Add protection/guide/help on pushing code (CI, code scanning, etc).

If you want, I can also **turn this into a checklist version** that works nicely in GitHub or Markdown for progress tracking—you can tick off items as you go. It won’t change your wording, just adds checkboxes.

Do you want me to do that?
